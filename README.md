# My-Cybersecurity-Journey-
Hello Github,! My name is Victoria Augustine Orinem, and I’m excited to share my professional journey with you all here. I have diverse background in advocacy, research, and administrative roles, which have sharpened my problem-solving skills and ignited my passion for being a part of creating positive changes.

My interest in cybersecurity stems from the challenge of protecting systems in our ever evolving digital world, the growing demand for skilled professionals in this field, personal experiences and my drive to make meaningful contributions to secure environments led me to pursue a scholarship-sponsored cybersecurity course, courtesy of The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERs).
This course has introduced me to the fundamentals of the cybersecurity, and I’m especially excited about Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Analysis. My long-term goal is to become a skilled cybersecurity professional, helping organizations manage risks effectively and ensure compliance with safety measures.
As I continue to build my skills, I’m looking to connect with professionals in the cybersecurity industry who can provide guidance and share their experiences. If you're in the field, I’d love to connect and learn from you!
Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. follow me, let’s connect and grow together.
